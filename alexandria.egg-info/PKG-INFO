# Introduction
Developers waste too much time searching for documentation, switching between browser tabs, and asking the same questions over and over. Alexandria eliminates that friction by scanning your project, indexing its dependencies, and using an AI-powered local assistant to answer your questionsâ€”instantly.

Whether you're working in Python, Node.js, Java, Rust, or Go, Alexandria automatically detects the libraries you're using and fetches relevant documentation. Instead of Googling "How do I use FastAPI middleware?", just:
```
alexandria chat
How do I use FastAPI middleware?
```
Powered by FAISS for fast semantic search and Ollama for local AI reasoning, Alexandria works entirely offlineâ€”no API calls, no sending your project data to external services.

### ðŸš€ Who is this for?

- Junior developers needing quick answers without jumping between docs

- Mid-level engineers working across multiple languages

- Senior developers who want a fast, private way to query dependencies in their proprietary projects

ðŸ‘‰ No more endless Googling. No more tab-switching. Just ask, and get your answer instantly.
